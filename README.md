This project was built using Django as a backend framework and HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and JavaScript as frontend programming tools. All generated details are saved in a database, which is SQLite by default.

All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.

- edit their own posts and save the edited posts
- like and unlike other users' posts

- Each page displays 10 posts. Usercs can navigate to the next page of posts using the pagination button on the bottom of each page
