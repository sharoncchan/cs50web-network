# Capstone Project

This project is a web application of a social network.

This project was built using Django as a backend framework and HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and JavaScript as frontend programming tools. All generated details are saved in a database, which is SQLite by default.

All webpages of the project are mobile-responsive.

#### Features of the project 
This project contains the features below where users can:
- write and submit a new post
- view the posts published by other users 
- edit their own posts and save the edited posts
- like and unlike other users' posts
- follow and unfollow other users
- Each page displays 10 posts. Usercs can navigate to the next page of posts using the pagination button on the bottom of each page


#### Running the application
  - Install project dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Dependencies include Django and Django MPTT module that allows Django to work with nested comments and replies.
  - Make and apply migrations by running `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`.
